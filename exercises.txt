1 - Create a springboot app as usual and put the salaries file to the resources folder

2 - the salaries file contains these columns:
ID, FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, FIRST NAME + LAST NAME, TAX ID, COMPANY WHERE THE PERSON WORKS, CITY WHERE HE WORKS, THE SALARY, THE OCCUPATION, NOTES

you will need this info to design the model.

you might need to delete the second row which contains the explanation for the file. Its useless when you read excel file and can throw exceptions.

3- We need the app to have these endponts:

1 - a get endpoint that triggers the reading of the excel file and returns the list of information
2 - a get endpoint that reads the excel file and imports all of the records on the mongo db
3 - a post endpoint that adds a new citizen information to the mongo db

after you are done importing every information to mongo db proceed with these:

4 - a get endpoint that returns all the records with salary higher than 70 000
5 - a get endpoint that returns all of the records with salary less than 70 000
6 - a get endpoint that searches the records by the name 
7 - a get endpoint that returns top 50 people with the highest salaries
